# Shellator
Shelling out in Ruby is way harder than it should be. Shellator, which is in
part a gem _just because it's a good name_, wraps `Open.popen3` in a consistent,
mostly-not-dumb way.

I've been dragging around a variant of [this blog post] for about three years
now and finally, _finally_, I have shamed myself into packaging it as a library
for use by friends, enemies, minions, and miscellaneous alike.

Enjoy.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shellator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shellator

## Usage
### Non-interactive commands ###
```rb
require 'shellator'

Shellator.noninteractive("docker build .",
                         stdout: ->(line) { puts line },
                         stderr: ->(line) { puts line })

```

### Providing non-interactively ###
`stdin_content` is optional. A newline will be appended after the content is
written to the subprocess stdout unless `stdin_newlines` is set to false.

```rb
require 'shellator'

Shellator.noninteractive("cat | tr abcdef ABCDEF",
                         stdin_content: ["a b c", "d e f"],
                         stdout: ->(line) { puts line },
                         stderr: ->(line) { puts "ERR: #{line}" })

# Output (on stdout):
# A B C
# D E F

Shellator.noninteractive("cat | tr abcdef ABCDEF",
                         stdin_content: ["a b c", "d e f"],
                         stdin_newlines: false,
                         stdout: ->(line) { puts line },
                         stderr: ->(line) { puts "ERR: #{line}" })

# Output (on stdout):
# A B CD E F
```

### Interactive commands ###
Not currently supported. If there was demand for this, I'd like to figure out a
way to weld the `popen3` approach to something like `PTY` for an Expect-like
experience.

That also probably means a state machine.

Suggestions/pull requests gratefully solicited.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
